A script that opens a exe with a jpg | AKA as a Image logger!

Explanation
So basically when you put your py file it then finds the jpg file and replaces the file with an exe of your stub link, therefore opening the exe file as the victim (dummie) opens the jpg thinking it's just a harmless jpg and it opens an exe. I'd recommend just getting replit or glithc or something to run this one, this then you send the victim the file and they will open and it will log them!

This is for educational purposes only! Please use this at your own risk as token logging although is not illegal it can be a hurtful thing to do to someone

Tutorial
The "YourImageLink" needs to be replaced with a link to a image example: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924433694133993482/938260977164632094/s.png. While the "MaliciousFIleDownloadLink" needs to be replaced with a download link to the file. example: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924433694133993482/938262761337671741/bad.exe Whenever someone clicks the image and hits "Open Origanal", right clicks the image and presses open link, or just click the image with their middle mouse button the file malicious file will download. Although it won't execute as I said before If you want to host your website globally i'd recommend using replit (https://replit.com)

Warning
Although the hacking community in general are pretty chill nice people there are a lot of bad actors on discord who sell fake things to try and scam people interested in hacking. People will sell things like fake "One Click" exploits for 50 dollars. Don't fall victim to these please. I came up with the project idea after seeing tons of fake "One Click Image Loggers" being sold. Unless someone can prove me wrong pretty sure this is the closest we'll get to a image logger on discord
